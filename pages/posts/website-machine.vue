      <p>In the post-WW2 reconstruction era, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9ton_brut" target="_blank"
          class="border-b-2 border-opacity-50 hover:border-opacity-100 border-primary">Béton Brut</a> —
        the French term for Raw Concrete — became the material of choice for architects tasked with the goal of
        rebuilding a war-torn Europe. In response to what must be considered
        the most catastrophic conflict in human history, a collective desire emerged to begin the process of rebuilding
        society. Inspired by the Modernist principle of "form follows
        function," architects sought to create buildings that embodied the ideals of utilitarianism, egalitarianism, and
        honesty . In Modernism, there was no need for the ornate
        flourishes typical of classical architecture. Instead, Architects of that time embraced Le Corbusier's
        perspective, treating homes as what they fundamentally are —
        <a href="https://www.open.edu/openlearn/history-the-arts/history/heritage/le-corbusier" target="_blank"
          class="border-b-2 border-opacity-50 hover:border-opacity-100 border-primary">machines for living in</a>.
      </p>

      <p>The radical shift towards functionality in architecture embodied in the Modernist movement was pushed to an
        extreme in Brutalism — a branch of its parent philosophy — by Le Corbusier himself. The proponents of this
        movement championed the use of raw concrete and the creation of imposing structures, forgoing decorative
        embellishments.
        This ensured that buildings were understood and <i>felt</i> for
        what they were, in their stark utilitarian essence, rather than designing under a framework that prioritized
        Romantic ideals and human emotions.
        In this way, Brutalist architects and planners were able to discard historical baggage, and begin their work of
        rebuilding again from a blank slate — of Béton Brut, of course.</p>

      <p>Le Corbusier's vision was brought to life with his seminal work <a
          href="https://www.archdaily.com/85971/ad-classics-unite-d-habitation-le-corbusier" target="_blank"
          class="border-b-2 border-opacity-50 hover:border-opacity-100 border-primary">Unite d'Habitation</a>, a housing complex in Marseille, France,
        finished in 1952 against grim and tumultuous backdrop of the post-WW2 era.
        His dictum, "A house is a machine for living in," encapsulated the utilitarian spirit that fueled Brutalist 
        and the push for an architecture that could address some of the
        worlds most pressing issues. In this sense, Brutalism was more than a mere
        stylistic preference; it was an emblem of shifting social and political current. The Brutalist movement gained
        prominence during a period marked by ideological
        tug-of-war between the world's two dominant powers, the Soviet Union and the United States. Both were trying to
        promote their vision for a world emerging from the ashes of ww2. In this chaotic period, societal focus shifted toward
        meeting people's basic needs through mass housing, public infrastructure, and affordability. Amidst these
        conditions, Brutalism stood out. Even with its fervent emphasis on function, however, Brutalism didn’t entirely sideline
        aesthetics, discovering a unique beauty in the rawness of, sometimes towering,
        exposed structures and materials.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl capitalize pt-8 pb-4">Translating Brutalism in the Digital Era</h2>

      <p>
        Elements of Brutalist design can be seen in the works and writings of several earlier Modernist thinkers.
        In his 1908 essay "<a href="https://designmanifestos.org/adolf-loos-ornament-and-crime/" target="_blank"
          class="border-b-2 border-opacity-50 hover:border-opacity-100 border-primary">Ornament and Crime</a>," Alfred
        Loos famously wrote, "The urge to ornament one's face and
        everything within one's
        reach is a primitive impulse." He went on to state, "The evolution of culture marches with the elimination of
        ornament from
        useful objects," thereby advocating a minimalist, functional design ethos. As we plunge further into the digital
        era,
        UI/UX designers must seriously consider the question of ornamentation, focusing specifically on the excesses of
        digital media
        consumption — what lessons can today's builders learn from the world that gave birth to Brutalism? More
        specifically, can the Brutalist ethos be
        accurately translated to a platform that, in recent years, has demanded excessive and ultra-abundant content,
        passive consumption, and constant
        attention? If we maintain that form should originate from function, how can we break through this wall of fleeting
        content and strip UI/UX design down
        to its barest essence, as Brutalism demands, while still remaining relevant and useful?


      </p>

      <p>Nowadays, we are witnessing a resurgence of Brutalism in the form of neo-Brutalism. However, this new iteration
        seems to lack the foundational philosophical drive that
        underpinned the original movement. In many ways, neo-Brutalism appears to replicate some of the very aspects
        Brutalism sought to challenge, aspects that would likely have
        been criticized by Alfred Loos. If the aim of Brutalism is to strip down a structure to its essence and highlight
        the strength of its raw material, then Brutalism in web
        design should reject the urge to ornament with aesthetic trends such as scrolling marquees and vertical text.
        Instead, it should aim to reveal the fundamental characteristics
        of its underlying technology. In this sense, Brutalism aligns with the hacker ethos of mastering the machine
        rather than being controlled by it.</p>
      <div class="blog-image">

      </div>

      <p>However, the reality is that not everyone desires to delve into the nuts and bolts or engage with raw materials.
        Often, simplicity and functionality suffice. For this reason, Modernism continues to hold an enduring appeal. 
        While Brutalism acts as a necessary counterbalance that keeps Modernism anchored on firm ground, it is simply too aggressive
        to be used in most use-cases.</p>

      <p>Contemporary UI/UX design must then allow for form to flow from function, however, with the understanding that the function of a website
        is to first convey information or provide tools, while, as at same time, doing so in a way that is delightful or, at least, keeps the user
        engaged in an ethical manner. 
        The concept of a website as a machine for information and delight echoes Le Corbusier's idea of a house being a
        machine for living in. Fundamentally,
        both Brutalism and web design strive to strike a balance between the practical and the pleasurable, the essential
        and the aesthetic. Keeping this in mind,
        we can refer to Dieter Rams' "<a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/us/about/good-design" target="_blank"
          class="border-b-2 border-opacity-50 hover:border-opacity-100 border-primary">Ten Principles for Good Design</a>"
        as a guide:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-none pl-10">
        <li class="pb-2 pt-1 relative"><span class="font-bold">Good design is innovative:</span> It doesn't merely
          replicate existing designs but strives to offer new solutions.</li>
        <li class="pb-2 pt-1 relative"><span class="font-bold">Good design makes a product useful:</span> It prioritizes
          the product's usability over its aesthetics.</li>
        <li class="pb-2 pt-1 relative"><span class="font-bold">Good design is aesthetic:</span> Despite the emphasis on
          usability, good design should also be visually appealing.</li>
        <li class="pb-2 pt-1 relative"><span class="font-bold">Good design makes a product understandable:</span> It
          clarifies the product's structure and operation.</li>
        <li class="pb-2 pt-1 relative"><span class="font-bold">Good design is unobtrusive:</span> Design should be
          neutral, providing room for the user's self-expression.</li>
        <li class="pb-2 pt-1 relative"><span class="font-bold">Good design is honest:</span> It doesn't make promises that
          the product can't fulfil.</li>
        <li class="pb-2 pt-1 relative"><span class="font-bold">Good design is long-lasting:</span> It avoids trends and
          thus never seems out of date.</li>
        <li class="pb-2 pt-1 relative"><span class="font-bold">Good design is thorough down to the last detail:</span>
          Nothing is arbitrary or left to chance.</li>
        <li class="pb-2 pt-1 relative"><span class="font-bold">Good design is environmentally-friendly:</span> It
          conserves resources and minimizes physical and visual pollution.</li>
        <li class="pb-2 pt-1 relative"><span class="font-bold">Good design is as little design as possible:</span> It
          focuses on the essential aspects of a product and eliminates the superfluous.</li>
      </ul>



      <p>With these principles in mind, it's crucial not to become overly preoccupied with theory. Sometimes, people
        simply want to feel or experience something,
        and that's perfectly okay - not everything needs to be tailored perfectly to modernist ideals. However, if your
        goal is to build a machine for information and delight,
        these principles serve as valuable guidance.</p>
