      </h2>
      <div class="leading-loose text-lg">
        <p>In the early 20th century, Modernism became the dominant architectural movement in Europe.
          Inspired by the Modernist principle of "form follows
          function," architects sought to create buildings that embodied the ideals of utilitarianism, egalitarianism, and
          honesty, eschewing the elaborate ornamentation customary in classical architecture.
        </p>

        <p>
          The radical shift towards functionality seen in the Modernist movement was pushed to an
          extreme by Le Corbusier who, under than banner of Burtalism, famously argued that <a
            href="https://www.open.edu/openlearn/history-the-arts/history/heritage/le-corbusier" target="_blank"
            class="border-b-2 border-opacity-50 hover:border-opacity-100 border-primary">a house is a machine for living
            in</a>. In line with this utilitarian approach, and against the backdrop of WWII reconstruction, architects
          of the day turned towards
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9ton_brut" target="_blank"
            class="border-b-2 border-opacity-50 hover:border-opacity-100 border-primary">Béton Brut</a> —
          the French term for Raw Concrete — as their material of choice for
          rebuilding a war-torn Europe. 


          Le Corbusier's vision was brought to life with his seminal work <a
            href="https://www.archdaily.com/85971/ad-classics-unite-d-habitation-le-corbusier" target="_blank"
            class="border-b-2 border-opacity-50 hover:border-opacity-100 border-primary">Unite d'Habitation</a>, an
          imposing concrete housing complex built in Marseille, France,
          and completed in 1952, introducing to the world an architectural framework with the potential to address some of the world's most
          pressing social issues.

     

        <p>
          While both Modernism and Brutalism allowed architects to discard certain historical baggage, they inevitably became constrained by new historical factors. This time, these constraints were associated with a quickly changing, increasingly global, and deeply tumultuous world shaken by conflict and social strife.
        </p>

      </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl capitalize pt-8 pb-4">The Dark Side of Brutalism</h2>
<p>
  On the surface, Brutalism championed a pragmatic approach to the construction of housing and infrastructure. From a more nuanced perspective, it was a response to the lightness of Modernism. Yet, on deeper level still, its aesthetic presentation was, consciously or subconsciously, animated by the horrors of WWII and the emerging power struggle between the West and the Soviet Union.  </p>
        <p>
As governments, and the world, became more dependent on automation and computerization, the importance of data, logistics and efficiency increasingly overshadowed
the more familiar and human-centric ways of life that many were used to. Brutalist buildings, then, made of raw concrete and devoid of visible humanistic considerations, were monuments to those changing times, giving shape to a reality that was otherwise nebulous and difficult to grasp, yet deeply troubling.
</p>
       

        <h2 class="text-2xl capitalize pt-8 pb-4">Translating Brutalism in the Digital Era</h2>

        <p> Brutalism in digital design has become a popular aesthetic trend in recent years. However, it has evolved in a way that is detached from the depth and significance of its original critique.

          With this new form of Brutalism, we no longer see the traditional lack of ornamentation or the use of raw materials; instead, we encounter excessive ornamentation, 
          bright colors, and unnecessary animations - the veneer of austrity and rawness covering over rampant consumerism in present-day digital media. </p><p>
       
        
          This deviation not only represents a step back for Brutalism but contrasts with Modernist principles, as well. As Alfred Loos's argues in his 1908 essay 
          
          <a href="https://designmanifestos.org/adolf-loos-ornament-and-crime/" target="_blank"
            class="border-b-2 border-opacity-50 hover:border-opacity-100 border-primary">Ornament and Crime</a>, the
          
          
          "evolution of culture marches with the elimination of ornament from useful objects."
        
        
        
        
        
        </p>
        <img class="w-full h-64 object-cover" src="/brutalistwebsites.jpg" alt="Blog post header image">
    <span class="pt-1.5 pb-7 inline-block text-white-800 text-base"> Various brutalist websites displayed on <a href="https://brutalistwebsites.com">brutalistwebsites.com</a></span>  
       <p>The website brutalistwebsites.com describes contemporary Brutalism as follows: </p>
    <p class="quote relative">
      <i-mdi:format-quote-open-outline class="absolute -left-10 text-4xl text-secondary"/>
      <i-mdi:format-quote-open-outline class="absolute -left-11 -top-1 text-4xl text-secondary opacity-30"/>
      In its ruggedness and lack of concern to look comfortable or easy, Brutalism can be seen as a reaction by a younger generation to the lightness, optimism, and frivolity of today's web design.</p>
    
    
      <p>
         With the vast majority of digital media essentially serving as ornament, we must ask, is the Brutalist framework - in the age of mass consumption - 
         
         
         
         
         
         
         
         truly capable of serving this medium or does digital media currently simply absorb and re-present all aesthetics for 
         
         an end-user in search of 'content'?
         
         </p><p>
         The above line of questioning
         opens two possible avenues for exploration: the first with regard to Guy Debord's concept of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_the_Spectacle" target="_blank" class="border-b-2 border-opacity-50 hover:border-opacity-100 border-primary">the Spectacle</a> and, the second, concerning the French Psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan's 'object petit a', both of which will be explored in a future post.

          <span class="pt-1.5 inline-block text-white-800 text-base">"Ex Machina" home — AI meets Brutalism in film.</span>
        </div>

        <p>If, according to Le Corbisier, a home is a machine for living in, then how shall we understand websites, given the Brutalist framework? 
          They are indeed machines for information but, is that all? </p><p>
            Whereas the primary function of a home is to provide shelter, a fundamental human need, websites serve a variety of purposes. They are used to document, for commerce, to communicate news and events, for politics, and sometimes simply for fun. 
            
            
            While impossible to cater to each of these needs, the principle of "form follows function" can be applied properly if the designer is able to identify the primary function of a particular website and pierce through the superficiality of an easily imitated surface aesthetic.
            </p>

        <p>Ultimately, however, we must acknowledge that the website is also a machine for delight, however subtle. Guiding the user to some information, presenting an interesting product, or writing about something useful all, when done properly, elicit a response that draws in the user.
          </p>
             <p>Keeping this in mind,
          we can refer to Dieter Rams' "<a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/us/about/good-design" target="_blank"
            class="border-b-2 border-opacity-50 hover:border-opacity-100 border-primary">Ten Principles for Good
            Design</a>"
          as a guide:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-none pl-10">
          <li class="pb-2 pt-1 relative"><span class="font-bold">Good design is innovative:</span> It doesn't merely
            replicate existing designs but strives to offer new solutions.</li>
          <li class="pb-2 pt-1 relative"><span class="font-bold">Good design makes a product useful:</span> It prioritizes
            the product's usability over its aesthetics.</li>
          <li class="pb-2 pt-1 relative"><span class="font-bold">Good design is aesthetic:</span> Despite the emphasis on
            usability, good design should also be visually appealing.</li>
          <li class="pb-2 pt-1 relative"><span class="font-bold">Good design makes a product understandable:</span> It
            clarifies the product's structure and operation.</li>
          <li class="pb-2 pt-1 relative"><span class="font-bold">Good design is unobtrusive:</span> Design should be
            neutral, providing room for the user's self-expression.</li>
          <li class="pb-2 pt-1 relative"><span class="font-bold">Good design is honest:</span> It doesn't make promises
            that
            the product can't fulfil.</li>
          <li class="pb-2 pt-1 relative"><span class="font-bold">Good design is long-lasting:</span> It avoids trends and
            thus never seems out of date.</li>
          <li class="pb-2 pt-1 relative"><span class="font-bold">Good design is thorough down to the last detail:</span>
            Nothing is arbitrary or left to chance.</li>
          <li class="pb-2 pt-1 relative"><span class="font-bold">Good design is environmentally-friendly:</span> It
            conserves resources and minimizes physical and visual pollution.</li>
          <li class="pb-2 pt-1 relative"><span class="font-bold">Good design is as little design as possible:</span> It
            focuses on the essential aspects of a product and eliminates the superfluous.</li>
        </ul>



        <p>With these principles in mind, it's crucial not to become overly preoccupied with theory. Sometimes, people
          simply want to feel or experience something,
        and that's perfectly okay - not everything needs to be tailored perfectly to modernist ideals. However, if your
        goal is to build a machine for information and delight,
        these principles serve as valuable guidance.</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl capitalize pt-8 pb-4">The Enduring Appeal of Modernism and Brutalism</h2>
<p>
  The preceding discussion is not intended as a rejection of Brutalism in favor of Modernism; rather, it aims to contextualize the Brutalist aesthetic to better understand its contemporary expression. Brutalism, at its inception, represented a dramatic shift away from the familiar classical architecture of its era. Similarly, today's digital Brutalism breaks away from the polished, minimalist aesthetic that dominates the digital landscape. However, something seems to be missing. Brutalism initially offered a critique of society, a critique that appears absent in many of today's reincarnations of the Brutalist aesthetic, despite such a critique being critically needed.

</p><p>
Any emerging aesthetic trend that takes on the current moment of over-consumption of digital images perhaps faces an uphill battle, yet, for the sake of humanity something can and inevitably will emerge.</p><p>
In the meantime, the designers of today will continue to map out a path forward, understanding that ultimately minimalism is pleasing, particularly in a wold that is overrun with imagery.
