        <p>In may the government released a <a class="border-b-2 border-opacity-50 hover:border-opacity-100 border-primary" href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/sg-youth-mental-health-social-media-advisory.pdf">report</a> detailing issues related to social media and mental health.
           While the report talks about pitfalls and negative consequences of too much screen time, it falls short contextualizing and explaining the phenomena from a theoretical perspective. 
           One way to approach this type of analysis is through the lens of Jacques Lacan's '<a
            href="https://thedangerousmaybe.medium.com/lacans-concept-of-the-object-cause-of-desire-objet-petit-a-bd17b8f84e69"
            target="_blank" class="border-b-2 border-opacity-50 hover:border-opacity-100 border-primary">object petit
            a</a>', which is a concept that describes the object of desire as a stand-in for the 'real' object of desire. We can combine this with 
           Guy Debord's concept of the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_the_Spectacle" target="_blank"
            class="border-b-2 border-opacity-50 hover:border-opacity-100 border-primary">the Spectacle</a>.
          
          
          
        </p>
        <p>For Lacan object petit a can represent the placeholder for a desire which cannot be satisfied. This desire is sustained through the cycle of lack
          and pursuit. Each time someone approaches the object of desire it moves slightly out of grasp keeping the desire wanting. 
          This effect is particularily pronounced with technology and social media - indeed, the appeal of the ideas come directly from it. 
        </p>
    <p>
      Unattainable object petit a can be also looked at from concerpts described in the buddhas fire sermon.
    </p>
  <p>From a neuroscience perspective you can also understand object petit a</p>
