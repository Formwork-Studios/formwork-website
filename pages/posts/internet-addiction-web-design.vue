        ">Le Corbusier & Brutalism in the age of Digital Design
        </h2>
        <p>In the early 20th century, Modernism became the dominant architectural movement in Europe.
          Inspired by the Modernist principle of "form follows
          function," architects sought to create buildings that embodied the ideals of utilitarianism, egalitarianism, and
          honesty, eschewing the elaborate ornamentation customary in classical architecture.
        </p>

        <p>
          The radical shift towards functionality seen in the Modernist movement was pushed to an
          extreme by Le Corbusier, the influential Swiss-French architect and urban planner, who, under the banner of
          Brutalism, famously argued that <a
            href="https://www.open.edu/openlearn/history-the-arts/history/heritage/le-corbusier" target="_blank"
            class="border-b-2 border-opacity-50 hover:border-opacity-100 border-primary">a house is a machine for living
            in</a>. In line with this utilitarian approach, and against the backdrop of WWII reconstruction, architects
          of the day turned towards
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9ton_brut" target="_blank"
            class="border-b-2 border-opacity-50 hover:border-opacity-100 border-primary">Béton Brut</a> —
          the French term for Raw Concrete — as their material of choice for
          rebuilding a war-torn Europe.


          Le Corbusier's vision was brought to life with his seminal work <a
            href="https://www.archdaily.com/85971/ad-classics-unite-d-habitation-le-corbusier" target="_blank"
            class="border-b-2 border-opacity-50 hover:border-opacity-100 border-primary">Unite d'Habitation</a>, an
          imposing concrete housing complex built in Marseille, France,
          and completed in 1952, introducing to the world an architectural framework with the potential to address some of
          the world's most
          pressing social issues.

</p>

        <p>
          While both Modernism and Brutalism allowed architects to discard certain historical baggage, they inevitably
          became constrained by new historical factors. This time, these constraints were associated with a quickly
          changing, increasingly global, and deeply tumultuous world shaken by conflict and social strife.
        </p>

        

        <h2 class="text-2xl capitalize pt-8 pb-4">The Dark Side of Brutalism</h2>
        <p>
          On the surface, Brutalism championed a pragmatic approach to the construction of housing and infrastructure.
          From a more nuanced perspective, however, it was a response to the lightness of Modernism. Yet, on a deeper
          level still, its aesthetic presentation was, consciously or subconsciously, animated by the horrors of WWII and
          the emerging power struggle between the West and the Soviet Union. </p>
        <p>
          As governments, and the world, became more dependent on automation and computerization, the importance of data,
          logistics and efficiency increasingly overshadowed
          the more familiar and human-centric ways of life that many were used to. Brutalist buildings, then, made of raw
          concrete and devoid of visible humanistic considerations, were monuments to those changing times, giving shape
          to a reality that was otherwise nebulous, difficult to grasp, yet deeply troubling.
        </p>


        <h2 class="text-2xl capitalize pt-8 pb-4">Translating Brutalism in the Digital Era</h2>

        <p> Brutalism in digital design has become a popular aesthetic trend in recent years. However, it has evolved in a
          way that is detached from the depth and significance of its original critique.

          With this new form of Brutalism, we no longer see the traditional lack of ornamentation or the use of raw
          materials, ie the display of code; instead, we encounter excessive ornamentation,
          bright colors, and unnecessary animations — the veneer of Austerity and rawness covering over rampant
          consumerism in present-day digital media. </p>
        <p>


          This deviation not only represents a step back for Brutalism but contrasts with Modernist principles, as well.
          As Alfred Loos's argues in his 1908 essay

          <a href="https://designmanifestos.org/adolf-loos-ornament-and-crime/" target="_blank"
            class="border-b-2 border-opacity-50 hover:border-opacity-100 border-primary">Ornament and Crime</a>,


          </p>
       


        <div class="quote relative pt-3 pb-6">
          <i-mdi:format-quote-open-outline class="absolute left-0 md:-left-10 text-2xl md:text-4xl text-secondary" />
        <div class="mx-10 md:mx-0">the evolution of culture marches with the elimination of ornament from useful objects.
        </div>
      </div>





       







        <p>
          With the vast majority of digital media essentially serving as ornament, we must ask, is the Brutalist framework
          — in the age of mass consumption —







          truly capable of serving this medium or does digital media currently simply absorb and re-present all aesthetics
          for

          an end-user in search of 'content'?

        </p>
        <p>
          The above line of questioning
          opens two possible avenues for exploration: the first with regard to Guy Debord's concept of the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_the_Spectacle" target="_blank"
            class="border-b-2 border-opacity-50 hover:border-opacity-100 border-primary">the Spectacle</a> and, the
          second, concerning the French Psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan's '<a
            href="https://thedangerousmaybe.medium.com/lacans-concept-of-the-object-cause-of-desire-objet-petit-a-bd17b8f84e69"
            target="_blank" class="border-b-2 border-opacity-50 hover:border-opacity-100 border-primary">object petit
            a</a>', both of which will be explored in a future post.
